Please provide as much information as possible when reporting a bug or filing an issue on the Windows Subsystem for Linux.

## Important: Reporting BSODs and Security issues
**Do not open GitHub issues for Windows crashes (BSODs) or security issues.**. Instead, send Windows crashes or other security-related issues to secure@microsoft.com.
See the `10) Reporting a Windows crash (BSOD)` section below for detailed instructions.

## Reporting issues in Windows Console or WSL text rendering/user experience
Note that WSL distro's launch in the Windows Console (unless you have taken steps to launch a 3rd party console/terminal). Therefore, *please file UI/UX related issues in the [Windows Console issue tracker](https://github.com/microsoft/console)*.

## Reporting issues in WSL
A well written bug report will follow the following template:

### 1) Issue Title
A title succinctly describing the issue.

#### Example:
`Traceroute not working.`

### 2) Windows version / build number
Your Windows build number.  This can be gathered from the CMD prompt using the `cmd.exe --version` command.

```cmd.exe
C:\ cmd.exe --version
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.21354.1]
```

Note: The Windows Insider builds contain many updates and fixes. If you are running on the Creators Update (10.0.15063) please check to see if your issue has been resolved in a later build.  If you are running on a Version below (10.0.14393), please try to update your Version.

#### Example:

`Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.21354.1]`

### 3) Steps required to reproduce

Should include all packages and environmental variables as well as other required configuration.

#### Example: On linux 

`$ sudo apt-get install traceroute && traceroute www.microsoft.com`

#### Example: On Windows

``
`$ cmd.exe` 
`CD C:\Windows\System32\`
`tracert.exe`
``

### 4) Copy of the terminal output

#### Example:

```
$ traceroute www.microsoft.com
traceroute to www.microsoft.com (23.75.239.28), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets
setsockopt IP_MTU_DISCOVER: Invalid argument
```

### 5) Expected Behavior

What was the expected result of the command?  Include examples / documentation if possible.

### 6) Strace of the failing command

Run the failing command under [strace](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/wily/man1/strace.1.html).  Normal command structure is:

```
$ strace -ff <command>
```

> Note: `strace` can produce lengthy output. If the generated trace is more than about 20 lines please paste this into a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) or another paste service and link in the bug.

#### Example:

```
$ strace traceroute www.microsoft.com
execve("/usr/bin/traceroute", ["traceroute", "www.microsoft.com"], [/* 22 vars */]) = 0
brk(0)                                  = 0x7fffdd3bc000
access("/etc/ld.so.nohwcap", F_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
mmap(NULL, 8192, PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANONYMOUS, -1, 0) = 0x7f1f4e820000
access("/etc/ld.so.preload", R_OK)      = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)
...
...
...
```

### 7) Additional information

Some bugs require additional information such as scripts to reproduce.  Please add to this section.

If there are files required, email the files to InsiderSupport@microsoft.com with:

* **Subject**:  Forward to WSL Team - RE: github issue <issue #>
* **Body**:  "Please forward to WSL Team" and include your attachment.

Common files are:

* Memory dumps found under C:\Windows\MEMORY.DMP
* Additional strace logs if the error occurs within a fork. The following
  command generates an output file for every fork created:

```
$ strace -ff -o <outputfile> <command>
```

#### wsl --mount

If the issue is about wsl --mount, please include the output of running `wmic diskdrive get Availability,Capabilities,CapabilityDescriptions,DeviceID,InterfaceType,MediaLoaded,MediaType,Model,Name,Partitions` in an elevated command prompt.

Example:

```
C:\WINDOWS\system32>wmic diskdrive get Availability,Capabilities,CapabilityDescriptions,DeviceID,InterfaceType,MediaLoaded,MediaType,Model,Name,Partitions
Availability  Capabilities  CapabilityDescriptions                                       DeviceID            InterfaceType  MediaLoaded  MediaType              Model                       Name                Partitions
              {3, 4}        {"Random Access", "Supports Writing"}                        \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0  SCSI           TRUE         Fixed hard disk media  SAMSUNG MZVLB512HAJQ-000H2  \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE0  3
              {3, 4}        {"Random Access", "Supports Writing"}                        \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1  SCSI           TRUE         Fixed hard disk media  SAMSUNG MZVLB1T0HALR-000H2  \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE1  1
              {3, 4, 10}    {"Random Access", "Supports Writing", "SMART Notification"}  \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE2  SCSI           TRUE         Fixed hard disk media  ST2000DM001-1ER164          \\.\PHYSICALDRIVE2  1

#### Collect WSL logs for networking issues

Install tcpdump in your WSL distribution using the following commands.
Note: This will not work if WSL has Internet connectivity issues.

```
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get -y install tcpdump
```

Install [WPR](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-recorder)

To collect WSL networking logs, do the following steps in an administrative powershell prompt:

```
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/WSL/master/diagnostics/collect-networking-logs.ps1" -OutFile collect-networking-logs.ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\collect-networking-logs.ps1
```
The script will output when log collection starts. Reproduce the problem, then press any key to stop the log collection.
The script will output the path of the log file once done.

### 10) Reporting a Windows crash (BSOD)

To collect a kernel crash dump, first run the following command in an elevated command prompt:

```
reg.exe add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\CrashControl /v AlwaysKeepMemoryDump  /t REG_DWORD /d 1 /f
```

Then reproduce the issue, and let the machine crash and reboot.

After reboot, the kernel dump will be in `%SystemRoot%\MEMORY.DMP` (unless this path has been overridden in the advanced system settings).

Please send this dump to: secure@microsoft.com .
Make sure that the email body contains:

- The Github issue number, if any
- That this dump is destinated to the WSL team

### 11) Reporting a WSL process crash

The easiest way to report a WSL process crash is by [collecting a user-mode crash dump](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/wer/collecting-user-mode-dumps).

To collect dumps of all running WSL processe, please open a PowerShell prompt with admin privileges, navigate to a folder where you'd like to put your log files and run these commands: 

```
Invoke-WebRequest -UseBasicParsing "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/WSL/master/diagnostics/collect-wsl-logs.ps1" -OutFile collect-wsl-logs.ps1
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force
.\collect-wsl-logs.ps1 -Dump
```

The script will output the path to the log file when it is done.

#### Enable automatic crash dump collection

If your crash is sporadic or hard to reproduce, please enable automatic crash dumps to catch logs for this behavior: 

```
md C:\crashes
reg.exe add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps" /f
reg.exe add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps" /v DumpFolder /t REG_EXPAND_SZ /d C:\crashes /f
reg.exe add "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps" /v DumpType /t REG_DWORD /d 2 /f
```

Crash dumps will then automatically be written to C:\crashes.

Once you're done, crash dump collection can be disabled by running the following command in an elevated command prompt:

```
reg.exe delete "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps" /f
```

### 12) Collect wslservice time travel debugging traces

To collect time travel debugging traces:

1) [Install Windbg preview](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windbg-preview/9PGJGD53TN86?hl=en-us&gl=us&rtc=1)

2) Open windbg preview as administrator by running `windbgx` in an elevated command prompt

3) Navigate to `file` -> `Attach to process`

4) Check `Record with Time Travel Debugging` (at the bottom right)

4) Check `Show processes from all users` (at the bottom)

5) Select `wslservice.exe`. Note, if wslservice.exe is not running, you make it start it with: `wsl.exe -l`

6) Click `Configure and Record` (write down the folder you chose for the traces)

7) Reproduce the issue

8) Go back to windbg and click `Stop and Debug`

9) Once the trace is done collecting, click `Stop Debugging` and close Windbg

10) Go to the folder where the trace was collected, and locate the .run file. It should look like: `wslservice*.run`

11) Share that file on the issue
